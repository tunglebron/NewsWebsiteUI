Cụ thể, tỷ phú người Nga Roman Abramovich đã đồng ý trả cho Messi 50 triệu bảng/năm sau thuế để thuyết phục tiền đạo này chuyển tới Premier League.<br>\r\n\r\nKhoản phí mà Chelsea đưa ra dành cho thương vụ \"bom tấn\" sẽ phá kỷ lục thế giới với lời đề nghị 225 triệu bảng. Đó là khoản tiền mà Chelsea chấp nhận bỏ ra để kích hoạt điều khoản giải phóng hợp đồng của Messi  thời điểm đó.<br>\r\n\r\nCả chủ tịch Roman Abramovich và HLV Jose Mourinho đều rất muốn hoàn tất bản hợp đồng này khi Messi có thể giúp Chelsea nâng tầm hình ảnh cũng như tạo ra sự đột phá về mặt chuyên môn. Theo chuyên gia chuyển nhượng Di Marzio, Real Madrid cũng từng thử lên phương án tương tự vào năm 2013 nhưng đội bóng hoàng gia Tây Ban Nha lập tức bị Messi từ chối vì lòng trung thành với đội chủ quản Barca.<br>\r\nĐược biết, cuộc tiếp xúc đầu tiên giữa Messi và Chelsea đã diễn ra vào tháng 1/2014 khi chân sút sinh năm 1987 đang vướng vào cuộc điều tra trốn thuế. Với tâm lý chán nản với các nhà chức trách Tây Ban Nha, Messi đã chủ động tìm kiếm một môi trường thi đấu mới.<br>\r\nSau đó, chính Messi đã làm giảm bớt căng thẳng từ người cha khi cho biết anh không quan tâm tới việc gia nhập Chelsea. Mọi thỏa thuận đã bị hủy bỏ khi Messi nghe lời cha mình để tiếp tục gắn bó với đội chủ sân Nou Camp. Tuy nhiên, thành công vẫn đến với Messi ở mùa giải sau đó khi anh cùng Barca giành cú ăn ba thần thánh (La Liga, Copa del Rey và Champions League).', 0, 5, 5579, 1, 1),
